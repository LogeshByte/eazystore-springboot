# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application has an API that returns product data successfully, but the products are not displaying in the frontend. This feature aims to identify and resolve the disconnect between the backend API and frontend product display functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see products displayed on the homepage, so that I can browse and purchase items from the store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the system SHALL fetch products from the API endpoint `/products`
2. WHEN the API returns product data THEN the system SHALL display the products in a grid layout
3. WHEN products are displayed THEN each product SHALL show name, description, price, and image
4. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN no products are returned THEN the system SHALL display "No products found" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug API connectivity issues, so that I can identify why products aren't displaying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the products loader function executes THEN the system SHALL log the API response for debugging
2. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN the component receives product data THEN the system SHALL validate the data structure
4. IF the API response structure is incorrect THEN the system SHALL handle the mismatch gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the product search and filtering to work properly, so that I can find specific products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products are successfully loaded THEN the search functionality SHALL filter products by name and description
2. WHEN products are successfully loaded THEN the sort functionality SHALL order products by price and popularity
3. WHEN search or sort is applied THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
4. IF no products match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display "No products found"
